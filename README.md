#### Pytorch Starter Code

- This project is adapted from [Pytorch-Project-Template](https://github.com/moemen95/Pytorch-Project-Template),
 please refer to that repository, as that have detailed explanation of project
 structure and diverse set of examples.
- Now I have only one example experiment, basic image classification. In the example
I did emotion classification on ckplus dataset.
- I did borrow code from several places, I did my best to keep a link to the source.
- This project is not complete (dataset preparation is missing), I plan to add a
image classification example on a publicly available dataset. So do not waste your
valuable time trying to run it. Feel free to read the 'agents/base_classification_agent.py'
to look at the additional features I added to suite my need.
